Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and Twilio. Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community! Four quality pull requests must be submitted to public GitHub repositories. You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

### Goal of this repository
There are many repositories on GitHub that contain a collection of algorithms and data structures in different programming languages. The goal of this repository is to provide a collection of algorithms and data structures in C++. Aim of this repository is to become a one-stop repository for all the algorithms and data structures in C++. 
Code should be well documented and easy to understand. The algorithms and data structures should be implemented according to the style guide mentioned below.

#### This repository is split into three sections:
- Basic<br>
In this section, you will find algorithms and data structures that are easy to understand and implement. These algorithms and data structures are a good starting point for beginners. There will 5 problems in this section.

- Loops<br>
In this section, you will find question which are based on iteration method, these problems are a good starting point for data structures and algorithm. There will be 10 questions in this section.

- Searching<br>
In this section, you will find algorithms and data structures used for searching an element in a given list. There will be 4 problems in this section.

- Sorting<br>
In this section, you will find algorithms and data structures used for sorting a given elements of list. There will be 10 problems in this section.

- Classes and Objects<br>
In this section, you have to implement the concept of classes and objects with a sample program of your own.
